# Stacks and Queues

These are different types of structures that excell at being used as programmer tools, limited access (FIFO, LIFO), and higher level of abstractions.

## Stack

Stacks allow access to only the last item inserted. Most microprocessors use a stack-based architecture. When a method is called, its return address and arguments are pushed onto a stack, and when it returns, they're popped off.

- Postal Analogy
  - You read through mail once per week and as you receive new letters, you push each onto the stack. When processing you start at the last inserted and work your way in reverse to the first element inserted.
  - The danger is if the stack gets too deep you may not ever make it back to the zeroth positon.
