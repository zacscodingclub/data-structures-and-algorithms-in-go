# Overview of Data Structures

## Characteristics of Data Structures

1.  Array:
    - Advangates: quick insertion, very fast access IF index known
    - Disadvantages: Slow search, slow deletion, fixed file size
2.  Ordered Array:
    - Advangates: quicker search than unsorted
    - Disadvantages: slow insertion and deletion, fixed file size
3.  Stack:
    - Advangates: Last-in, first-out access (LIFO)
    - Disadvantages: Slow access to other items
4.  Queue):
    - Advangates: First-in, first-out access (FIFO)
    - Disadvantages: Slow access to other items
5.  Linked List
    - Advangates: Quick insertion, quick deletion
    - Disadvantages: Slow search
6.  Binary Tree
    - Advangates: Quick search, insertion, deletion (if tree remains balanced)
    - Disadvantages: Delegation algorithm is complex
7.  Red-black Tree
    - Advangates: Quick search, insertion, deletion. Tree always balanced
    - Disadvantages: Complex
8.  2-3-4 Tree
    - Advangates: Quick search, insertion, deletion. Tree always balanced. Similar trees good for disk storage.
    - Disadvantages: Complex
9.  Hash Table
    - Advangates: Very fast access if key known. Fast insertion
    - Disadvantages: Slow deletion, access slow if key not known, inefficient memory usage
10. Heap
    - Advangates: Fast-insertion, deletion, access to largest item
    - Disadvantages: Slow access to other items
11. Graph
    - Advangates: Models readl-world situations
    - Disadvantages: Some algorithms are slow and complex

## Summary

- A data structure is the organization of data in a computer's memory or in a disk file
- The correct choice of data structure allows major improvements in program efficiency.
- Examples of data structures are arrays, stacks, and linked lists.
- An algorithm is a procedure for carrying out a particular task.
- In Java, an algorithm is usually implemented by a class method.
- Many o fthe data structures and algorithms described in this book are more often used to build databases.
- Some data structures are used programmer's tools: They help execute an algorithm.
- Other data strucutre model real-world situations, such as telephone lines running between cities.
- A database is a unit of data storage compsed of many similar records.
- A record often represents a real-world object, such as an employee or a car part.
- A record is divided into fields. Each field stores one characteristic of the object described by the record.
- A key is a field in a record that's used to carry out some operation on the data. For example, personnel records might be sorted by a LastName field.
- A database can be searched for all records whose key field has a certain value. This value is called a search key.
