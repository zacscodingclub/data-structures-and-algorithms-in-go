# Arrays

## Summary

- Unordered arrays offer fast insertion but slow searching and deletion.
- Wrapping an array in a class protects the array from being inadvertently altered.
- A class interace is composed of the methods (and occaisionally fields) that the class user can access.
- A class interface can be designed to make things simple for the class user.
- A binary search can be applied to an ordered array.
- The logarithm to the base B of a number A is (roughly) the number of times you can divide A by B before the result is 1.
- Linear searches require time proportional to the number of items in an array.
- Binary searches require time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items.
- Big O notation provides a convenient way to compare the speed of algorithms.
- An algorithm that runs in O(1) time is the best, O(log N) is good, O(N) is fair, and O(N^2) is bad.
