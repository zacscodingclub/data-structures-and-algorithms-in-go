# Simple Sorting

- Since sorting is so important and potentially time-consuming, it has been the subject of extensive research in computer science. This chapter will discuss some of the slower, more naive algorithms because they are easier to understand and can actually be better for specific use cases.

1.  Bubble Sort

    - Notriously slow, but simplest to consider.

2.  Selection Sort
3.  Insertion Sort
