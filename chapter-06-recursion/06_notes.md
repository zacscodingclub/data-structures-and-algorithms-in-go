# Recursion

Programming technique in which a method calls itself. It is often not inherently more efficient, but that it simplifies the problem conceptually.

## Characteristics of Recursive Methods

1. It calls itself.
2. When it calls itself, it does so to solve a smaller problem.
3. There is a "base case" that is simple enough that the routine can solve it, and return, without calling itself.
