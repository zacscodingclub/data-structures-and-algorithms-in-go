# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

Someone gave me this old book [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Java-2nd/dp/0672324539) by Robert Lafore and this repo is my conversion of the examples and lessons to [Go](https://golang.org/). This is a pretty old edition as it looks like they are up to the sixth edition now and I suspect that newer editions are mostly slight changes to Java versions and/or syntax instead of a change in those underlying concepts.

Soon I'll be writing blogs including the content in a more consumable way: https://zacbaston.com
